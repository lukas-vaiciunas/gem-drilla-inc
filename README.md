Dig gems, pocket cash, and upgrade your drill! How deep can you go?

As an employee of Gem Drilla Incorporated, you are tasked with mining and selling ores and gems. As you grow your capital, you unlock the ability to upgrade your drill and increase its fuel capacity, mining efficiency, and movement speed.

Developed over the course of three days for [Mini Jam 109: Depths](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-109-depths)!

The game engine was developed in C++ and the SFML library.

Your progress is automatically saved each time you visit the main menu.
